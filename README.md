# The_Iron_Community
**The Iron Community** is a web application dedicated to nature lovers. It aims to create a vibrant, supportive space where people passionate about the environment, wildlife, hiking, and all things natural can come together, share stories, and inspire each other.

##  Project Overview

This project is part of my Holberton School Webstack specialization portfolio. It’s a full-stack application built with **Flask (Python)** on the backend and **React** on the frontend.

 Mission

To connect people who care about nature through a beautiful and functional digital platform — a space to:
- Share experiences from nature.
- Discover and contribute to eco-friendly tips.
- Join events and hikes.
- Support environmental causes.

## Inspiration

Nature is healing, energizing, and essential. This platform is for people who want to give back to nature and connect with others who feel the same.
